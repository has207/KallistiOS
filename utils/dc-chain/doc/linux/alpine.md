# Sega Dreamcast Toolchains Maker (`dc-chain`) with Alpine Linux #

This document contains all the instructions to create a fully working
toolchains targeting the **Sega Dreamcast** system under **Alpine Linux**.

**Alpine Linux** is a regular **GNU/Linux** system but it's a great candidate
for making **Docker** images; that's why a special document was written for
that distribution.

## About Docker images ##

You may use the `docker` directory in order to have an example of working
`Dockerfile`.

## Introduction ##

On **Alpine Linux** family system, the package manager is the `apk` tool.

All the operations in this document should be executed with the `root` user. 
You have to type the `su -` command which comes installed by default on
**Alpine Linux**.

## Prerequisites ##

Before doing anything, you will have to install some prerequisites in order to
build the whole toolchains.

### Installation of required packages ###

The packages below need to be installed:
```
apk --update add build-base patch bash texinfo libjpeg-turbo-dev libpng-dev	curl wget
```	
At this time of writing, the `libelf-dev` package was missing from the main
repository, so you have to execute the following to install it:
```
apk --update add libelf-dev --repository=http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/main
```
This may not be necessary depending if the `apk` repository was updated. Please
keep in mind that you have to install the `libelf-dev` package.

### Installation of additional packages ###

These additional packages are required too:
```
apk --update add git python subversion
```
**Git** is needed right now, as **Subversion Client** and **Python 2** will be
needed only when building `kos-ports`. But it's better to install these now.

By the way you can check the installation success by entering something like
`git --version`. This should returns something like `git version X.Y.Z`.

## Preparing the environment installation ##

Enter the following to prepare **KallistiOS** and the toolchains:
```
mkdir -p /opt/toolchains/dc/
cd /opt/toolchains/dc/
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/cadcdev/kallistios kos
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/cadcdev/kos-ports
```
Everything is ready, now it's time to make the toolchains.

## Compilation ##

**KallistiOS** provides a complete system that make and install all required
toolchains from source codes: **dc-chain**.

The **dc-chain** system is mainly composed by a `Makefile` doing all the
necessary. In order to work, you'll need to provide a `config.mk` file. Read
the main `README.md` file at the root for more information.

### Making the toolchains ###

To make the toolchains, do the following:

1. Navigate to the `dc-chain` directory by entering:
	```
	cd /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/utils/dc-chain/
	```
2. Enter the following to start downloading and building toolchain:
	```
	make
	```
Now it's time to take a coffee as this process is really long: several hours
will be needed to make the full toolchains!

### Making the GNU Debugger (gdb) ###

If you want to install the **GNU Debugger** (`gdb`), just enter:
```
make gdb
```
This will install `sh-elf-gdb` and can be used to debug programs through
`dc-load/dc-tool`.

### Removing all useless files ###

After everything is done, you can cleanup all temporary files by entering:
```
./cleanup.sh
```
## Next steps ##

After following this guide, the toolchains should be ready.

Now it's time to compile **KallistiOS**.

You may consult the `README` file from KallistiOS now.
